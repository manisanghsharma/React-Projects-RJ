## Stop Watch Project
## Using custom hooks

Intuitions : 

1. To start with I first created routes in main file using react router dom.
2. Next I created a header file to add title of stop watch and add responsivess using useWindowSize() hook.
3. To move on further with the project, I thought to create a separate file for the box of stop watch, then timing of the stop watch, then three buttons file and one file to hold their functionalities. 
4. I have used Custom Hooks.
